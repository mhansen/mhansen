### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently leading engineering teams working on Google Maps for Android Automotive, building Google Maps into car infotainment systems.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build static analysis.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [improving Graphviz's docs](https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz.gitlab.io)
